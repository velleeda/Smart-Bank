# Smart-Bank

Project created in one of Alura's React courses to learn about how to abstract CSS with Styled Components. <br />

In it I learned how/when: <br />

- To understand class name conflicts with CSS;
- To use Styled Components inside the project;
- To use inheritance within components;
- To use global styles.
